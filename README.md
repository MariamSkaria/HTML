# HTML Codes:A Journey Through Pure HTML

## ✨ Description

Welcome to my personal collection of **HTML-only** code snippets! This repository showcases my gradual learning process in mastering the fundamentals of **HTML**, free from CSS or JavaScript.

The goal here is to dive deep into the core of HTML — building structured, simple webpages using **just** HTML elements, tags, and attributes, without external styling or interactivity. It's all about understanding the building blocks before layering on styling and functionality.

## 🌱 Purpose

- **Gradual Learning**: Each example represents a step forward in my HTML journey, focusing on essential concepts and syntax.
- **HTML Fundamentals**: A space to experiment with and solidify the basics of HTML structure.
- **Pure HTML**: No external styles (CSS) or scripts (JS) – just the raw, fundamental power of HTML.

## 🗂️ Repository Contents

Here you'll find a variety of HTML code examples demonstrating:

- Basic page layouts.
- Simple forms and tables.
- Lists, links, and other essential HTML elements.

Each example is designed to be **clean** and **easy to understand**, perfect for anyone wanting to explore HTML without distractions.
